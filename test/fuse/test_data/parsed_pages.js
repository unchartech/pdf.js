"NFM  are  found  primarily  in  buildings,  packaging,  automobiles  andindustrial equipment. User industries are essentially foundries, refineriesand other heavy industriesRecycling  of  end-of-life  products  will  become  increasingly  essentialsince  it  is  the  only  source  of  secondary  non-ferrous  metal,  whereasprimary  resources  are  shrinking.  Several  other  factors  also  favor  thedevelopment  of  non-ferrous  metal  recycling.  First,  the  production  ofprimary  ore  is  nonexistent  in  many  areas  of  the  world.  Recycledproducts  are  thus  the  only  “surface  mine”  available  and  are  also  arenewable source; in all cases, the reutilization of recuperated productsleads to savings in raw materials.In  addition,  the  production  of  secondary,  recycled  products  is  muchcheaper  than  manufacturing  primary  products  from  ore.  lvestmentsrequired are, on average, three to four times lower than for refiningore. Energy savings compared to the production of primary metal areabout 60 to 80% for copper and 90 to 98% for aluminum – a clear-cutcompetitive  advantage  in  a  context  of  soaring  energy  costs  andincreasingly severe restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions in Europe.Even  so,  production  cost  savings  are  partially  offset  by  the  costs  ofcollection  and  by  environmental  restrictions  in  industrialized  nations.These  limitations  are  less  restrictive  in  emerging  countries,  whichincreasingly  use  this  type  of  production  and  import  recuperatedproducts.The   recuperation   of   end-of-life   products   alone   accounts   forapproximately  35%  of  global  NFM  production  (source:  Bureau  ofinternational  recycling).  The  global  demand  for  non-ferrous  metalscorrelates  strongly  with  changes  in  the  global  industrial  productionindex.A major shift occurred in 2018, with China’s decision to publish verystrict  specifications  for  impurity  levels  in  19  classes  of  products(including  non-ferrous  metals)  in  order  to  import  them  into  China.These maximum rates are in practice very difficult to achieve, and thevolume of Chinese imports has decreased significantly since the springof  2018.  Consequently,  the  volumes  previously  consumed  by  Chinahave shifted to other markets, resulting in downward pressure on theprices of various non-ferrous metals. The tables below summarize theprice changes for various metals",
